AI-program that solves the 8-puzzle 
8 pieces scattered initially in 3x3 shape, 1 piece is an empty spot where neighboring pieces can move. The goal is to assemble them in a certain order.
In my case:
0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8

Implemented with Breadth-first search and Iterative Deepening Depth-first search
